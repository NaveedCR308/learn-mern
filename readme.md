# Learn MERN

This repository contains daily lectures, tasks, and projects that I use to teach MERN stack web development to my students at **IT Artificer**. 

## About the Course

The course covers the core technologies of the MERN stack:
- **MongoDB** for database management
- **Express.js** for backend framework
- **React.js** for frontend development
- **Node.js** for server-side execution

Each folder represents a day's work, including lecture notes, coding examples, and exercises to help students gain hands-on experience.
